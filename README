NAME
    CPAN::Mirror::Finder - Find a locally-configured CPAN mirror

SYNOPSIS
      use CPAN::Mirror::Finder;
      my $finder = CPAN::Mirror::Finder->new;
      my @mirrors = $finder->find_all_mirrors;

      my @cpanmini_mirrors = $finder->find_cpanmini_mirrors;
      my @cpan_mirrors = $finder->find_cpan_mirrors;
      my @cpanplus_mirrors = $finder->find_cpanplus_mirrors;

DESCRIPTION
    This modules makes it easy to find a locally-configured CPAN mirror.
    There are many ways to have a CPAN mirror. The most explicit is to use
    CPAN::Mini with a configuration file to have an entirely local CPAN
    mirror.

    Also CPAN.pm can be configured with details of CPAN mirrors.

    Also CPANPLUS can be configured with details of CPAN mirrors. This also
    contains sensible defaults if the user has not configured anything.

    All methods return URI objects.

METHODS
  find_all_mirrors
    Returns a combination of all the ways of finding locally-configured CPAN
    mirror:

      my @mirrors = $finder->find_mirror; # returns all the following

  find_cpanmini_mirrors
    Returns a local CPAN::Mini mirror, if any:

      my @cpanmini_mirrors = $finder->find_cpanmini_mirrors;

  find_cpan_mirrors
    Returns the mirrors configured by CPAN.pm:

      my @cpan_mirrors = $finder->find_cpan_mirrors;

  find_cpanplus_mirrors
    Returns the mirrors configured by CPANPLUS:
